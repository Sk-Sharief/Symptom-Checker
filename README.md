## 🤖 Machine Learning Integration

### Current Implementation
The app currently uses a mock ML model for demonstration. To integrate a real model:

1. **API Endpoint Structure**
   ```typescript
   // Expected API endpoint: POST /api/predict
   interface PredictionRequest {
     symptoms: string[];
   }
   
   interface PredictionResponse {
     predictions: {
       id: string;
       commonName: string;
       scientificName: string;
       probability: number;
       description: string;
     }[];
   }
   ```

2. **Integration Points**
   - Replace the `predictDiseases()` function in `DiseasePrediction.tsx`
   - Update the API call in the useEffect hook
   - Handle loading states and error scenarios

### Recommended ML Model Features
- **Input**: Array of symptom strings
- **Output**: Ranked list of potential diseases with confidence scores
- **Training Data**: Medical symptom-disease datasets
- **Model Type**: Classification model (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Network)

## 💾 Database Integration

### Required Data Structures

1. **Symptoms Table**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE symptoms (
     id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
     category VARCHAR,
     common_co_symptoms TEXT[]
   );
   ```

2. **Diseases Table**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE diseases (
     id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
     common_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
     scientific_name VARCHAR,
     description TEXT,
     severity_level INT
   );
   ```

3. **Remedies Table**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE remedies (
     id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
     disease_id VARCHAR REFERENCES diseases(id),
     title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
     description TEXT,
     category VARCHAR,
     warnings TEXT[]
   );
   ```

## 🏥 Medical Safety Features

- **Disclaimers**: Clear medical disclaimers on all prediction pages
- **Emergency Guidance**: "When to see a doctor" sections for each condition
- **Severity Indicators**: Visual probability indicators for conditions
- **Safe Remedies**: Only evidence-based, safe home remedies included
